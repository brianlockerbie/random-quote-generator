## Random Quote Generator

This is the first of ten projects for the 🏡 Treehouse TechDegree Full Stack JavaScript.

I created a single-paged app that displays a quote at random each time the button is clicked. Building this project allowed me to practice using basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, object literals and data structures.
